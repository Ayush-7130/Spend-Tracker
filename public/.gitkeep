# This file ensures the public/ directory is tracked by Git even when empty.
# The public/ directory is used by Next.js for static assets like images, fonts,
# and other files that should be served directly from the root URL path.
#
# Place your static assets here:
# - Favicon files (favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png, etc.)
# - robots.txt
# - sitemap.xml
# - Images and other media files
# - Any files that need to be accessible at yourdomain.com/filename
